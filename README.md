# DSAMentorAI

DSAMentorAI is a very basic web-based tool for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
Itâ€™s not groundbreaking, but hey â€” it works! Think of it as a Sunday side project that makes DSA feel a little less intimidating (and maybe a bit more fun ðŸ˜…).


---

## Features
- Practice common DSA problems (because LeetCode wasnâ€™t enough ðŸ™„).
- Just a casual project made on a lazy Sunday ðŸ˜‚.
- No AI hype hereâ€¦.
- Runs in your browser â€” no 32GB RAM or quantum computer required.
